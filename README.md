# RDR1-Undead-Weapons-Online


This is the source code to get undead weapons online in freeroam as well as mp gamemodes other than undead overrun. 


This should work on any rdr version (so long as undead dlc is installed or using undead nightmare base game)

You get blunderbuss, torch, holy water, zombie bait, zombie boom bait, & zombie spit online.
- You must ER Bypass at mainmenu to use all weapons.
- Without er bypassing at mainmenu only blunderbuss and torch will work [this only works atm on Xbox360: Media ID - 5B48AF70: Undead Nightmare [NON GOTY] Region free].
- In order to use zombie boom bait or zombie spit, you must use demonic rev weapon spawner to force those weapons in your hand or use the example function in example.c
- In example.c you will see a force weapon in hand function, and you will also see the pointer that allows blunderbuss, torch, and er without having to ER bypass.
- That pointer only works with the above mentioned game version. Feel free to find that same pointer on diff game versions/platforms.
