This is work in progress and atm is unfinished as is.

Help from ImFoxxyyy & Cain532 for native documentation

I originally had a source with all throwables + zombie spit weapons, non working because of vector 3 data but lost that version of the source long ago.

Credit will be given to somebody if they get those working before I ever do, as I don't code on this game much at all anymore.
