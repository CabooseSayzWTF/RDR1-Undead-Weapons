# RDR1-Undead-Weapons-Online


This is the source code to get undead weapons online in freeroam as well as mp gamemodes other than undead overrun. 


This is work in progress and atm is unfinished as is.
-- You MUST be ER Bypassed at game mainmenu to get these weapons online once you execute the compiled version of this source.
-- You can also try using this pointer to get the weapons without er bypassing at mainmenu. [*(int*)0x824B57B8 = 0x4E800020;] This blocks weapon delete from inventory in memory.
-- As is, that pointer is for [Xbox 360: Media ID - 5B48AF70: Undead Nightmare [NON GOTY] Region free].

You get Blunderbuss + torch online. Throwables are being looked into as well as zombie spit weapon.
All Undead ammo types supported as well.

Help from ImFoxxyyy & Cain532 for native documentation

I originally had a source with all throwables + zombie spit weapons, non working because of vector 3 data but lost that version of the source long ago.

Credit will be given to somebody if they get those working before I ever do, as I don't code on this game much at all anymore.
